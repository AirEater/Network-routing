Configure IP addresses and gateway addresses for all PCs.

There is 3 routers connected to a switch. The network id is 200.1.1.0
Router0 ip:200.1.1.1, Router1 ip:200.1.1.2, Router3 ip:200.1.1.3

Go to the router0 CLI, type "en", then go to config mode with "conf t".
type "ip route (dest_network) (subnet_mask) (next_hop_ip). 
//next_hop_ip is gateway that where the data from router to router, for example router0 to router1
  router1's interface 200.1.1.2 is the next_hop_ip
 after done setting up the network route, we can go to "en" mode type "show ip route" to check routing
 nearby router will show *directly connected* to (nearby_network_ip)
