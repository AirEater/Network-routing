After we have set all the IP addresses for the PCs and gateway addresses.
we go to router that we want to set for dynamic route, for example router0
go to router0's CLI enter the config mode, type "router rip", 
then type"network (network_id_directly_connect_to_router)", if there is 3 directly connected network id,
we have to type 3 times.
